# Advanced SpellChecker
This task is forked from a basic spell checker based on unigram model.

Differently, the holbrook.txt is used as test data, which contain over 1200 labelled data.

And a bigram model is built here as the language model using nltk's corpus.

As a result, a different computation of correction is generated here and the accuracy function has also changed slightly.

Nevertheless, POS and Stemming have not been used in this task.

# Result
The accuracy achieved 93.75% for spell correction in sentences.
